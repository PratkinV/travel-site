                    <p><strong>Clear View Escapes</strong> was established in 2010 by <a href="https://vk.com/id247811134">Victor Pratkin</a>. Victor became familiar with tourism during his first 5 months trip to USA as a participant of Work And Travel program in 2008. During this trip he traveled a lot across the country and he was told by the bus drivers that more and more people travel independently, looking for advice about hotels, sights to see and things to do and company. He did some research and he found out that there are many offers for people who would like to travel in a group but almost none for people who prefer to travel independently. And since Victor himself is not the “group-kind-of-traveler” the idea to start Clear View Escapes developed:</p>
                    <p><em>“I do not like to travel within a large group of people and when I founded Clear View Escapes in 2010 the simple idea was to provide a service for travelers like myself. Although it may be the right thing for some people to book a guided tour and travel within a group it is just not my way of travel. I like to be more <strong>independent</strong>. If I want to have a cup of coffee somewhere, I want to take the time to sit down and have that cup. If I visit a specific site I may want to stay a little longer, maybe to enjoy the quietness or peacefulness of that particular place. Also during my journeys to foreign countries, I noticed that as an independently traveling person, contacts to locals, which enriched my travel experiences, were much easier.”</em></p>
                    <p>Clear View Escapes focuses on English-speaking guests looking for a tour in <strong>California</strong>. For singles, couples, families or small groups of friends traveling together Clear View Escapes provides beautifully designed Rail-, Coach- and Self-drive tour packages.</p>
					<p><em>“The idea behind Clear View Escapes is to provide itineraries which make travel easy for people who prefer to have freedom in travel. <strong>Conveniently designed itineraries, arranged in the most efficient way to keep costs down</strong>. And which allow you to have a great travel experience!”</em></p>

                    <p>&ldquo;What a wonderful trip! The planning by Victor and his crew was perfect. The hotels were centrally located allowing for city walking tours. The auto rental was great and the route planning and iteneraries with GPS coordinates were so helpful. The museum/castle pass with specific info for each site including where to park made the trip stress free. So grateful for the wonderful travel planning. Will use them again for another trip to California.&rdquo;</p>

The itinerary of the different towns was a perfect pace as well as the tours booked. Definitely would recommend CVE to anyone looking to book a trip to California and unsure how to navigate the train and hotel arrangements. They are very responsive and accommodating.&rdquo;</p>
